Simple way to pull down a remote branch and switch to it  
`git remote -r` to see all remote branches  
`git switch <remote branch name>`

> If you want to check out a remote branch (that doesn't yet exist as a local branch in your local repository), you can simply provide the remote branch's name. When Git cannot find the specified name as a local branch, it will assume you want to check out the respective remote branch of that name
