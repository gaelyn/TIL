For my first medium post, I was trying to format some code blocks and saw other articles where the author had embedded a github Gist code block into their Medium post.   

[Here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/embed-github-gist-code-snippet-medium-article-mazen-kilani/) are the steps I found.  

1. Create a public Gist and name it appropriately with `.md` extension.
1. Add code block and click `Create public gist`
1. In top right of the screen in the drop down choose `Share` and copy link.
1. In your Medium post, click on the `+` sign and choose `<>` to embed.
1. Copy and past link and hit `return`
